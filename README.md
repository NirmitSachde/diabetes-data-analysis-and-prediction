### Diabetes Data Analysis and Prediction

**File Name:** `Diabetes-Data-Analysis-Prediction.ipynb`

**Description:**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting diabetes outcomes using a comprehensive dataset. It employs various machine learning techniques to classify patients based on their likelihood of having diabetes.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizes visualizations to understand data distribution, correlations, and patterns.
- **Model Training:** Implements multiple models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks for classification.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
- **Feature Importance:** Identifies key features influencing diabetes prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Employs GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.

**Setup:**
1. **Environment:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and CatBoost.
2. **Data:** Use the provided dataset or similar datasets for diabetes prediction.
3. **Execution:** Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab with GPU support for faster model training.

**How to Use:**
- Load and preprocess the dataset as outlined in the notebook.
- Perform EDA to gain insights into the data.
- Train and evaluate different models using the provided code.
- Use the best-performing model for predictions on new data.

**Contributing:**
- Contributions to improve model accuracy, add new datasets, or enhance visualization are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests.
